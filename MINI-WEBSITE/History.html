        <h2>HERITAGE MARVELS</h2>
        <p>Badoc Church, also known as St. John the Baptist Church, was where the painter Juan Luna was baptized in 1857, as were his siblings Laureana and Manuel Andres.Established by the Augustinians, the chapel of Sinait was constructed here in 1591. It became a parish in 1714 under the patronage of St. John the Baptist. The church and convent are constructed of stone and chalk (tisa). It was invaded by the Sambal people (a tribe from the Zambales area) in 1660-1661.The old arch of brick and mortar still greets visitors. Inside the church compound, as common to colonial-era churches in the Philippines, are the church proper and a belltower; in this case, the latter is a separate structure from the former.The church's façade has been whitewashed; on the lintel above its simple door of wooden planks grows a plant, a symbol of life and rebirth. Massive brick buttresses, twelve on each side, hold up the church and keep it stable. Inside, the floor is laid with green, yellow ochre, and cream machuca tiles as well as the more prosaic red Vigan tiles.</p>
